Introductory blurb.

\section{Testing of the Original Program}

Sadly, I missed a lot of beggining of the year and participated in Code to win competition
in Waterloo and also Hack Concordia so didnt have time to finish my own programm

\section{Results of Testing Partner's Code}

In order to test the program, I created a ordered list of 1000 strudents, 
where each next student has a little bit less GPA, using formula:
next students GPA = random number from 99.82% to 100% of previous student GPA
gender and choise is also assigned randomly
also, during initialization of the list, we count the number of students
of each gender and sum of their GPA to get the average one.

To test sort, we created clone of test list and random shuffle it
after sorting, we should get the same list, wich is easily to check

For average GPA test, we call the function for male and female and compare 
with our generated result. We also can see that the difference is smaller then
1E-10, wich is normal error for float

For allocation we assigned capacity for each faculty as 150 and get the last student in my list
the right of free choice, then, we just need to check that:
1. We didnt exeeded the 150 capacity
2. We have assigned special student somewhere
3. In each faculty all students are sorted (because original list was sorted)

Allocation didnt work on my computer because of the feature of dict
(On my computer we cant directly use result of get() function and gives error:
TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable)

\section{Discussion of Test Results}

It would probably work in some enviroment without type restriction

\subsection{Problems with Original Code}

\subsection{Problems with Partner's Code}

Described in above sections

\section{Critique of Design Specification}

It is pretty well described for me

\section{Answers to Questions}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]

\item I would instead of g for gender, I would make it more general, then we can find average
not only by gender, also by prefered faculty or by the name. Just instead of two argument, we
would need one mor, but thats okay.
For sort we can do something like sort in c++, so have choice to give a function with 
ording criteria

\item answer

\item The ReadAllocationData is just program for input, and also in your requirement we can 
use our own input file, so in this case is hard to make general test for it. Also, if I
understand it right, to test something, we need the right answer first. Here the only thing we can 
check is the structure of our dictionaries.
